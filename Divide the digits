Problem
You are given a number N. 
You are required to form two numbers X  and  Y such that:

The sum of frequency of each digit in X and  Y is equal to frequency of that digit in N.
The sum of numbers  Xand  Y must be minimum.
Your task is to determine the minimum possible sum of  X and Y.

Input format
The first line contains an integer T that denotes the number of test cases.
For each test case:
The first line contains an integer N.

Output format
For each test case, you are required to print the minimum possible sum of  X and  Y in a new line.

Sample Input
2
1321
42255

Sample Output
25
270

Explanation

For the first test case:
Minimum possible sum is 25 , which can be achieved if .
X=12, Y=13

For the second test case:
Minimum possible sum is 270 , which can be achieved if .
X=245, Y=25

Solution
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    l=list(input().strip())
    l.sort()
    print(int(''.join(l[0::2]))+int(''.join(l[1::2])))
