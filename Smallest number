Smallest number

Problem

You are given a string S that represents a number. This string consists of the following characters only:
1,2,3

You can perform the following operation:
Swap any two adjacent characters only if the absolute difference between the characters is 1

Your task is to determine the smallest number that can be formed by using the provided operation. You can perform this operation any number of times (possibly zero). 
Note: Assume 1  based indexing.

Input format
The first line contains an integer T that denotes the number of test cases.

For each test case:
The first line contains an integer that denotes the length of string S.
The second line contains a string that denotes the string S.

Output format
For each test case, print a string representing the smallest number that can be formed in a new line.

Sample Input
2
5
11223
6
213123

Sample Output
11223
122313

Solution
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
  n= int(input())
  s=input()
  pos=s.find('3')
  pre=s[:pos]
  suf=s[pos:]
  pre+=''.join(c for c in suf if c=='2')
  suf=''.join(c for c in suf if c!='2')
  print(''.join(sorted(pre))+suf)
