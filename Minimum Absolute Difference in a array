Given an array of distinct integers arr, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements.

Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair [a, b] follows

a, b are from arr
a < b
b - a equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in arr
 
 Example 1:

Input: arr = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Explanation: The minimum absolute difference is 1. List all pairs with difference equal to 1 in ascending order.

solution:
n=sorted(arr)
m=float('inf')  #we can give value as 10**20
l=[]
for i in range(1,len(n)):
  diff= abs(n[i-1]- n[i] )
  if diff < m :
    m=diff
    l=[]
  if diff==m:
    l.append([n[i-1],n[i]])
   
print(l)
