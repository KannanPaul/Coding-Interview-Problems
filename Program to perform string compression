Suppose we have a string s. We have to compress this string into Run length encoding form. 
So when a character is repeated k number of times consecutively like 'bbbb' here letter 'b' is repeated four times consecutively, so the encoded form will be 'b4'. 
For single characters we shall not add the count into it.

Input
"abbbaaaaaaccdaaab"

Output
ab3a6c2da3b

Python Solution:
s = "abbbaaaaaaccdaaab"
res = ""
cnt = 1
for i in range(1, len(s)):
  if s[i - 1] == s[i]:
    cnt += 1
  else:
    res = res + s[i - 1]
    if cnt > 1:
      res += str(cnt)
    cnt = 1
res = res + s[-1]
if cnt > 1:
  res += str(cnt)

print(res)
